        <p class="p1">The Tiger is the largest member of the cat family.  They can be over 4 ft. tall, 9 ft. long, and as much as 675 lbs.  These beautiful beasts range in small pockets from the tropical forests in Southeast Asia to the mountainous coasts of Russia.  Their diet includes Ambar Deer, Wild Pigs, Antelope and even Water Buffalo. </p>

        <div class="column1of2">
        <p class="p2">Just 100 years ago there were 9 different species of Tigers, and their population was over 100,000 glorious felines. They ranged from as far West as Turkey, and had dense populations in China, Russia, and Southeast Asia. Those numbers today are drastically smaller due to illegal hunting for their pelts and body parts in addition to habitat loss from logging and other forms of forrest destruction.</p>
